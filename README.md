# Machine Learning Specialization Repository

This repository serves as a centralized location for storing and organizing all the Optional Labs and Practice Labs (Jupyter Notebooks) for the Machine Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.ai and Stanford University on Coursera. The specialization consists of three courses covering various aspects of machine learning.

## Specialization Overview

The Machine Learning Specialization consists of the following courses:

1. **Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
   - Covers the principles and algorithms used in supervised learning, focusing on regression and classification tasks.

2. **Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms**
   - Explores advanced learning algorithms, such as multi-class classification decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.

3. **Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**
   - Focuses on unsupervised learning techniques, recommendation systems, and reinforcement learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Course 1**
  - Contains the Optional Labs and Practice Labs for each week of Course 1.

- **Course 2**
  - Stores the Optional Labs and Practice Labs for each week of Course 2.

- **Course 3**
  - Holds the Optional Labs and Practice Labs for each week of Course 3.

- **Resources**
  - Provides additional resources, such as datasets, libraries, and useful references, that can complement the course materials.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Machine Learning Specialization, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-specialization.git `

2. Navigate to the desired course directory, e.g., `Course 1`.

3. Explore the Optional Labs and Practice Labs for each week. These Jupyter Notebooks provide hands-on exercises to reinforce the concepts taught in the course.
